config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_VENDOR
	string "custom toolchain vendor name"
	default "buildroot"
	help
	  This option allows to customize the "vendor" part of the
	  toolchain tuple, where the toolchain tuple has the form
	  <arch>-<vendor>-<os>-<libc>. The default value, "buildroot",
	  is fine for most cases, except in very specific situations
	  where gcc might make different decisions based on the vendor
	  part of the tuple. The value "unknown" is not allowed, as the
	  cross-compiling toolchain might then be confused with the
	  native toolchain when the target and host architecture are
	  identical. The value can not be empty either.

	  If you're not sure, just leave the default "buildroot" value.

	  This option is visible if no C library is available for the
	  currently selected configuration. If you select this option,
	  the build will refuse to start as Buildroot needs a C
	  library to build a toolchain. Change your configuration
	  settings to make sure one of the C libraries is selected.
