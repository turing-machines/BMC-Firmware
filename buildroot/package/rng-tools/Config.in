	  The Jitter RNG provides a noise source using the CPU
	  execution timing jitter. It does not depend on any
	  system resource other than a high-resolution time stamp.

	  Enable NIST Entropy Beacon support.

	  Entropy gathered from the NIST network entropy beacon. Note
	  that this entropy source is disabled by default as it should
	  never be used for cryptographic purposes, or any use case in
	  which random data should be known only by a single entity.

	select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCURL
	help
	  Enable Qrypt NIST-Beacon like entropy support.

	  Entropy gathered from Qrypt server based entropy beacons. Like
	  NIST, it should likely not be used directly in cryptographic
	  operation, as the entropy may be intercepted over a network,
	  but can provide copius amounts of entropy for non-crypto
	  purposes.
