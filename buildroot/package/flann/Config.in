	  FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest
	  neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a
	  collection of algorithms we found to work best for nearest
	  neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing the
	  best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the
	  dataset.
