	  GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial
	  data formats. As a library, it presents a single raster
	  abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to
	  the calling application for all supported formats. It also
	  comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data
	  translation and processing.
