	  AGENT++ is a set of C++ classes which provides a complete
	  protocol engine and dispatch table for the development of
	  SNMP agents. AGENT++ is a multilingual API which supports
	  SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3. It provides various C++ classes
	  implementing prototypes for scalar and table SNMP managed
	  objects that can be customized by derivation. Additional
	  classes support the development of proxy agents as well as
	  sending notifications.

	  SNMPv3 support is enabled if SNMP++ enables it.
