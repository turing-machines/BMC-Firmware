	  Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for
	  developers using C++.

	  Qtdoc contains the main Qt Reference Documentation, which
	  includes overviews, Qt topics, and examples not specific to
	  any Qt module. The configuration files are located in
	  qtdoc/doc/config and the articles in qtdoc/doc/src. Note that
	  QDoc itself is located in qtbase.
