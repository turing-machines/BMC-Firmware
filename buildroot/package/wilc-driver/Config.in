	  External kernel module for WILC1000/3000 devices.

	  wilc kernel driver source as found in Microchip's at91-linux
	  kernel tree with added Kbuild file to be built as a generic
	  external module.

	  The wilc1000 driver currently maintained in Linux kernel does
	  not support BLE of the WILC3000 hardware. This package is
	  meant to bridge that gap until Microchip can get WILC3000
	  support upstream.

	  Supports both SDIO and SPI modes.

config BR2_PACKAGE_WILC_DRIVER_SPI
	bool "SPI"
	help
	  This module adds support for the SPI interface of adapters
	  using WILC1000/3000 chipset. The WILC1000/3000 has a Serial
	  Peripheral Interface (SPI) that operates as an SPI slave.
	  This SPI interface can be used for control and for serial
	  I/O of 802.11 data. The SPI is a full-duplex slave
	  synchronous serial interface that is available immediately
	  following reset when pin 9 (SDIO_SPI_CFG) is tied to VDDIO.
	  Select this if your platform is using the SPI bus.

config BR2_PACKAGE_WILC_DRIVER_SDIO
	bool "SDIO"
	help
	  This module adds support for the SDIO interface of adapters
	  using WILC1000/3000 chipset. The WILC1000/3000 SDIO is a full
	  speed interface. It meets SDIO card specification version 2.0.
	  The interface supports the 1-bit/4-bit SD transfer mode at the
	  clock range of 0-50 MHz. The host can use this interface to
	  read and write from any register within the chip as well as
	  configure the WILC1000/3000 for data DMA. To use this
	  interface, pin9 (SDIO_SPI_CFG) must be grounded. Select this
	  if your platform is using the SDIO bus.

	bool "Enable out-of-band interrupt"
	help
	  This option enables out-of-band interrupt support for the
	  WILC1000/3000 chipset. This OOB interrupt is intended to
	  provide a faster interrupt mechanism for SDIO host controllers
	  that don't support SDIO interrupt. Select this option If the
	  SDIO host controller in your platform doesn't support SDIO
	  time division interrupt.
