	  NetworkManager is a set of co-operative tools that make
	  networking simple and straightforward. Whether WiFi, wired,
	  3G, or Bluetooth, NetworkManager allows you to quickly move
	  from one network to another: once a network has been
	  configured and joined once, it can be detected and re-joined
	  automatically the next time it's available.
