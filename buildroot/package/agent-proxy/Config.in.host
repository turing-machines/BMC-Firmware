	bool "host agent-proxy"
	help
	  This is a simple, small proxy which was intended for use
	  with kgdb, or gdbserver type connections where you want to
	  share a text console and a debug session.

	  The idea is that you use the agent-proxy to connect to a
	  serial port directly or to a remote terminal server.
