	  Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it
	  also provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple
	  BDD macros.

	  Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and
	  natural. Tests autoregister themselves and do not have to
	  be named with valid identifiers, assertions look like
	  normal C++ code, and sections provide a nice way to share
	  set-up and tear-down code in tests.

	  This package allows running testsuites on the target which
	  might be advantageous in certain cases.
