	help
	  GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for
	  numerical computations. It provides a convenient command
	  line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems
	  numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments
	  using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It
	  may also be used as a batch-oriented language. Octave has
	  extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
	  problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations,
	  integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials,
	  and integrating ordinary differential and
	  differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible
	  and customizable via user-defined functions written in
	  Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules
	  written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.

comment "octave needs a toolchain w/ C++ and fortran, gcc >= 4.8"
