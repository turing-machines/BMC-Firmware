	  libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard
	  C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those
	  signals to any callback function, either global or a member
	  function, regardless of whether it is static or virtual.

	  This is the last version before the API and ABI change
	  introduced in 3.0.0 which requires C++17.
