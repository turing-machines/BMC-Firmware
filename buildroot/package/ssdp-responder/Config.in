	  Simple Service Discovery Protocol daemon (SSDP) for networked
	  Linux and UNIX devices. Useful in any setup, big or small, but
	  targeted more at embedded systems that need to announce
	  themselves to Windows systems.

	  The project consists of ssdpd and ssdp-scan.  The former is a
	  stand-alone UNIX daemon, it has no dependencies but a standard
	  C library.  It comes with built-in web server for serving the
	  UPnP XML description on port 1901, the XML is used by Windows
	  to present the icon, by default an InternetGatewayDevice is
	  announced.

	  ssdp-scan is a tool, similar to mdns-scan, to find other SSDP
	  capable hosts on the network.  Take care to only use it for
	  debugging, or quicker device discovery operations, since it
	  scans the network quite aggressively.
