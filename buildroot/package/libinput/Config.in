	  libinput is a library to handle input devices in Wayland
	  compositors and to provide a generic X.Org input driver.
	  It provides device detection, device handling, input device
	  event processing and abstraction so minimize the amount of
	  custom input code compositors need to provide the common
	  set of functionality that users expect.
