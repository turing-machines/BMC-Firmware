Subject: [PATCH 09/17] sunxi: enable support for SPI NAND booting on SUNIV

As we added support for SPI NAND to the existing SPL SPI codepath, route
the boot code to it when it detects the BROM loads SPL from SPI NAND, as
for SoCs with both SPI NAND and boot media indicator support, the boot
media indicator is the same for SPI NOR and NAND.
