# Official Turing Pi BMC firmware

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/turing-machines/BMC-firmware/build.yml?style=for-the-badge)

Welcome to the new home of the Turing Pi firmware. The Turing Pi is a compact AI
& edge computing cluster purposed to run cloud stacks and AI inference at the
edge. Find out more on our [website](turingpi.com).

### Wenyi0421 Repository

The Wenyi0421 repository was formerly used for firmware development. We have
decided to branch off and commit our fresh inputs to this repository, which
implies that we will gradually phase out the Wenyi0421 repository. Currently, we
are working towards a first release, which will land here soon.

    * Linux 5.4
    * Linaro GCC 7.2
    * U-boot bootloader

## Install firmware

There are two ways to upgrade the firmware on your current board.
1. Using the PhoenixSuit. It allows you to write an entire new image to the
board.
2. Using an OTA package. This package can be uploaded to the board via the web
UI. (This method does not update the kernel).

The required images can be found in one of our release packages. get the latest
[here](https://github.com/turing-machines/BMC-firmware/releases).

On our
[website](https://help.turingpi.com/hc/en-us/articles/8686945524893-Baseboard-Management-Controller-BMC-)
you can find an elaborate manual on performing an update using both methods.

## Setup build environment

### Using Docker

In the root of our repository there is a dockerfile which can be used to build
a development container. It has all the dependencies needed to build the
firmware. We recommend to go through the official docker documentation. But if
you want to quickly build and run it, execute the following commands in the root
of your repository:

```shell
# build the docker image
docker build . -t tp_container

# open the docker container
docker run -it -v $PWD:$PWD --workdir $PWD tp_container
```

### Natively

Currently, only X86 Linux build hosts are supported. They are
required to have the following packages installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion git-core
libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk flex quilt libssl-dev xsltproc
libxml-parser-perl mercurial bzr ecj cvs unzip lib32z1 lib32z1-dev lib32stdc++6
libstdc++6 libncurses-dev u-boot-tools mkbootimg -y
```

## Build

To build the firmware image manually, execute the following command:

```shell
cd buildroot
make BR2_EXTERNAL=../tp2bmc tp2bmc_defconfig
make
```

To package up a swu (for OTA update via webui):

```shell
cd output/images/
cp -a ../../../tp2bmc/swupdate/* .
./genSWU.sh 1.0.0
```
